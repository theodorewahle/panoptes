# This is our security video platform!

Right now, we have:

1. A backend server that streams video (click ![HERE](https://github.com/theodorewahle/panoptes/blob/main/backend/README.md) for more info, including how to run)
2. A frontend webapp that is deployed on heroku, and it will eventually stream video from the backend (see documentation ![HERE](https://github.com/theodorewahle/panoptes/blob/main/frontend/README.md))
3. Some experiments completed with computer vision (![HERE](https://github.com/theodorewahle/panoptes/blob/main/computer-vision/COMPUTER_VISION.md) is the readme for that)
