# This our video streaming platform!

Right now, we have:

1. A backend server that stream video (click HERE for more info, including how to run)
2. A frontend webapp that is deployed on heroku, and it will eventually stream video from the backend (see documentation HERE)
3. Some experiments completed with computer vision (HERE is the readme for that)
