  - Incident Viewer Page
  - Search Results Page
- Confirm best format to store data coming from back-end in redux
- Build a video player? Some libraries...

  - [video-react](https://video-react.js.org/)
  - [shake-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shaka-player)
  - [video.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/video.js)
  - ...
- Make sure every page collapses cleanly all the way to mobile version
- Deploy
  - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)?
